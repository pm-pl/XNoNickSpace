<br> ‚úîÔ∏è Protection from unwanted nicknames: The plugin prevents players with nicknames containing spaces or invisible characters from joining, ensuring cleanliness and professionalism on your server.
<br> ‚úîÔ∏è Flexible restriction settings: You can configure additional limitations for nicknames. For instance, you can allow spaces in the middle or at the end of nicknames by selecting the corresponding settings in the plugin menu.
<br> ‚úîÔ∏è Dual Language Support: The XNoNickSpace plugin comes with built-in support for two languages directly from the source code, making it easy to cater to a broader player base with different language preferences.
<br> ‚úîÔ∏è In Beta mode, you will have the option to add a prefix to your players' nicknames instead of kicking them if they have a space or invisible character.
<br> ‚úîÔ∏è The plugin also features flexible settings where you can enable a notification for all server players when a player with a space in their nickname joins.


#### :question: Why did **XNoNickSpace** appear?

The idea behind creating this plugin emerged after many players attempted to impersonate the administration by simply adding spaces or invisible characters to the beginning or end of their nicknames. After searching the internet, I couldn't find an equivalent, which led to the decision of gifting this creation to the community.
